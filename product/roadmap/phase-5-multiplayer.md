# Phase 5: Multiplayer

**Status**: COMPLETE (Superseded by Phase M)

This phase was originally planned to use Mirror networking. The actual implementation used **Photon PUN 2** instead and was completed as part of Phase I/M.

See [Phase M: Multiplayer Bug Fixes](phase-m-multiplayer.md) for the full multiplayer implementation and bug fix history.
